## Summary

BAswap is a bilingual (English/Việt) Streamlit dashboard that fetches real-time environmental data from our buoy in Vinh Long, and presents in an interactive, user-friendly way. Users can filter by date, measurement type, and aggregation functions, then export to CSV for offline analysis.
