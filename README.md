## 🗒️ Summary

This website is part of our BASWAP (Buoy-based AIoT System for Water Quality Monitoring & Prediction) project. This repository features a bilingual (English/Việt) Streamlit dashboard that visualizes multi-station real-time EC (salinity proxy) data on an interactive map, displays station warning levels, and station statistics. For each station, the app also shows observed vs. predicted EC trends with uncertainty intervals, supports hourly/daily views and up-to-date monitoring.
