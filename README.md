## 🗒️ Summary

This website is part of our Buoy-based AIoT system for water quality monitor and prediction (BASWAP) project. This repository features a bilingual (English/Việt) Streamlit dashboard that fetches real-time environmental data from our buoy in Vinh Long, and presents in an interactive, user-friendly way. Users can filter by date, measurement type, and aggregation functions, then export to CSV for offline analysis.
